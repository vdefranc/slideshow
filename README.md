This is plain JavaScript slideshow. My first effort was based on the addition and removal of css classes. It was ugly and it also had small bug. That version is on branch classes-and-timeouts.

My second attempt is on master. It uses a setInterval to animate the slides. I feel this solution is more elegant.
